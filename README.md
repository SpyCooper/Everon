# Everon
As of writing this on Decemeber 19, 2023, Everon was an incomplete project I started in late June 2023. I had planned on finishing it but after 2.5 months of work over the summer, I abandoned the project because of my schooling.

It was supposed to be a recreation of a game my friends and I used to play on Roblox called Vesteria. I had planned on changing many parts of it such as different abilities, classes, story, etc, but I do not have an interest, or think I will be able to finish it currently. I believe if I had been able to keep up my work pace for another 2-3 months, I could have finished most of the starting zone and allowing the player to properly level up to level 8 or so. Images of the zones, menus, etc are include in the "sketeches" folder.

A video of what I had created over this 2.5 months in the game is available to watch as the "EveronSepShowcase.mov" or on my LinkedIn and the runnable testing area is in the "runnable exe" folder.

I perhaps will one day finish this but as of right now, I think working on other projects will be a better use of my time.
